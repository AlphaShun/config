/**
 * @description login 
 * @date 2019-06-29
 * @param {*} ip		Server's ip address
 * @param {*} port		Server's port
 * @param {*} strategy  I think we can use websocket, polling, long polling, HTTP persistent connection, keep-alive 
						or sth like webHook, watcher to implement the communication feature.
						Here I use websocket and use reactive programming by rxjs. 
						I do this mainly for a push pattern when data changed:
						Explanationï¼š
						1. the ws receive the message which is the new config
						2. push the data into observable
						3. values who subscribe the observable will be notified which means they will change immediately

 * @param {*} auth		I guess client can log in through token, cookie, username/password or just a secret we provide
						And, since it is a toy for a skeleton, I have no interest to implement them all. So I assume that a 							client that sends 'vt' after connecting is the trusted client and the connection will not be closed then

 * @param {*} secret 	The data to transfer when log in.
